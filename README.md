# How to understand the data analysis part of a paper: A quick checklist for biology students

This guide is meant as a tool for biologists to help them understand the essence of the data analysis done in tpyical biology papers. Individuals can use it as a checklist by reading papers. It could also be used as a teaching tool, either as part of an introductory statistics class or as a short workshop, e.g. within a journal club. It might also come in handy for those writing a paper. 

The dream is to have not just a list, but for every item, have a positive example and a negative example, or something else that would help someone decide whether that criterion has been reached.

This is a work in progress; suggestions and improvements are more than welcome! If you decide to pilot this within a class, please let me know about your experiences.

## Experimental Design and Data collection

- [ ] What is the sample size? What did the authors do to convince you that is it large enough? (E.g. power analysis)


- [ ] What is the research question? What is the hypothesis? What is the corresponding Null Hypothesis?

- [ ] What information was collected? How does the information collected relate to the research question(s)?

- [ ] What controls can you think of (both positive and negative)? What controls did the authors do?

- [ ] For each experiment, do you understand
	* the setup of the experiment
	* what results one would expect under what assumptions

- [ ] Are confounding factors controlled for? What biases might there be in experimental setup, data collection, and sampling, and have those been accounted for? 

- [ ] What would it take to convince you? (E.g. what level of significance, what sample size, what effect size, what complementary experiment)?

## Data processing

- [ ] How were outliers handled? Do you understand the rationale behind this?

- [ ] Did the authors transform the data (e.g. log-transform), and do you understand why?

- [ ] Were the data grouped into categories (e.g. high, medium, low), and do you understand the rationale behind that?

- [ ] Were there procedures for background subtraction, normalisation, noise reduction etc., and do you (roughly) understand the ideas behind them?

## Data reporting

- [ ] Do you understand what all terms and variables mean?

- [ ] What units are used?

- [ ] Are all data shown? Is there something you feel is missing?

## Data visualisation

- [ ] What do the axes on plots show? What are the units? Where is the origin? (Be especially careful to compare axes if two plots are shown side-by-side)

- [ ] How are colours and patterns used? What is the experimental condition, what is the control?

- [ ] What do symbols on the plot represent (e.g. individual data points, means, medians etc.)? If they represent aggregate data, how many data points are represented by one symbol in the plot? 

- [ ] If the data is represented in a novel or unusual way, do you understand what it is you are looking at?

- [ ] What is the "message" you get from the plot?

## Data analysis

- [ ] What statistical tests are used? Do you understand (in essence) what they do?

- [ ] What software is used for statistical analysis? Are you familiar with it? If not, do you understand (in essence) what it does?


## Interpretation

- [ ] Do you agree with the conclusions drawn from the data analysis?

- [ ] If cause-and-effect statements are made, are you convinced that a cause-and-effect relationship exists (rather than a mere correlation, or a reverse effect)?

- [ ] Are you convinced that the findings are significant? 

- [ ] Do you agree with the conclusions regarding the proposed hypothesis?

- [ ] Can you think about alternative explanations?

- [ ] If the findings seem to conflict with earlier findings, can you venture a guess about where those differences come from? 

## Outlook

- [ ] Are there "missing pieces" that you would like to have seen included in order to be convinced?

- [ ] Can you think about other experiments to take this research further?
