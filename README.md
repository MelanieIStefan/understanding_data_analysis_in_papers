# How to understand the data analysis part of a paper: A quick checklist for biology students

This guide is meant as a tool for biologists to help them understand the essence of the data analysis done in tpyical biology papers. Individuals can use it as a checklist by reading papers. It could also be used as a teaching tool, either as part of an introductory statistics class or as a short workshop, e.g. within a journal club.

This is a work in progress; suggestions and improvements are more than welcome! If you decide to pilot this within a class, please let me know about your experiences.
